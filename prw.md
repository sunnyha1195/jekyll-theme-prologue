I have only recently become so obsessed with writing product requirements. I, in the beginning, stuck to writing the bare minimum, because I was having the feeling that no one ever looked at them after they were written. And you know what? It's still a partial truth as far as I have experienced. But I have also learned that this line of thinking was not and is not helpful. A little while ago, when I looked back into a few of the projects I've worked on in the past to showcase to my colleagues for related tasks at that time, I realized the discrepancy between product requirements and documentations that were well-written and ones that were not. My memory still served me well to make the best out of the poorly-written documentations, but it was honestly not enough. Since then, I have started to think about how can I write better requirements that people would <i>and</i> could read whenever necessary.

While I am still learning and dearly wishing to have further training and workshops on it to become better at it, here are some takeaways I have obtained since then. 
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the topic into functional and non-functional requirements</li>
            <dl>It's important to understand that there are different needs for the users using the feature and for the dev team to ensure security and quality in implementation.</dl>
        <li>Use the time to see how to further breakdown the components</li>
            <dl>No one enjoys complex requirements with many dependent components. One of the reasons why I hated writing requirements was because we wanted to add so many components to the concept that it was too complicated to even write them down coherently.</dl>
        <li>Use diagrams, charts, tables, and etc.</li>
            <dl>When there are complicated flows to understand, nothing helps more than visual aids.</dl>
        <li>Write down every detail and get them checked</li>
            <dl>Nothing is more frustrating than requirements constantly changing or finding out the requirements cannot be realized in a reasonable fashion and having to redo everything.</dl>
    </ol>
</p>

Perhaps I will learn over time that some of the takeaways I have gotten can be improved. Nevertheless, it's a topic that I am greatly interested in and hope to improve on, so I am not afraid of that.
