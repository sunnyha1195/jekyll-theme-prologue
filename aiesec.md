<p>
AIESEC is a student organization that I have taken a big part in during my university time. 
</p>
<h3><b>My Responsibilities</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Helped students in the process of planning, going, and coming back from social exchanges abroad</li>
    <li>Worked as the leader in the HR team to recruit students to work for the organization</li>
    <li>Worked as the leader of the committee in TÃ¼bingen, overseeing all areas of the organization including HR, finance, exchanges, and marketing</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>My Takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>A team effort outweighs individual effort</li>
    <li>Culture is a critical part to any organization's success and mentality in facing challenges</li>
    <li>Trust makes people responsible, not the other way around</li>
    <li>Overseeing many different components of an organization is complex and difficult but it is what I do enjoy</li>
</ul>
