<p>
Puppeteer is a headless browser library in NodeJS that has myriads of use cases in automating processes for both the average users and businesses. In my case, I have used Puppeteer as an automated image and pdf export tool.

<h3><b>My Responsibilities</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Created puppeteer component that would screenshot and output a file of a given url</li>
    <li>Created Java render implementation that would execute the puppeteer component via commandline and retrieves the data to provide to the user</li>
    <li>Collaborated with a frontend to ensure that the puppeteer component's request to access a certain server page that should be rendered is properly handled</li> 
</ul>
<h3><b>My Takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Simple and complex libraries included in Java are not the only solutions that could be available</li>
    <li>Servers need scalable solutions that are resource-friendly</li>
</ul>
