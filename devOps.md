I started out as a Software Engineer with a focus on the Backend but ended up expanding my responsibilities in the devOps environment. 
</p>

<h3><b>My Responsibilities</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Responded to all server incidents, analyzing the issue and resolving it with the team</li>
    <li>Analyzed major incidents with the use of all data at hand and successfully resolved near-critical crashes</li>
    <li>Took responsibility of server deployments and releases</li>
    <li>Monitored and ensured functionality of different instances</li>
    <li>Supported front-office in backoffice tasks via JMX, metabase, and server log analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>My Takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>In many backend development cases, having knowledge of the devOps environment is extremely helpful to understand and better implement the required component</li>
    <li>There is no harm in double and triple checking configurations before releases</li>
    <li>Most often when something does not work, it will lead to an incident. Sadly, it may be that you only figure out why after it has all happened</li>
    <li>I have an eye for analyzing situations and grasping the context</li>
</ul>
