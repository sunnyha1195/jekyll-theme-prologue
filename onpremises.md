<p>
Onpremises handling was originally not a responsibility in my job description. As <a href="/devOps">devOps came to be</a>, I had to take the responsibility due to internal reasons. 
</p>
<h3><b>My Responsibilities</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Contributed majorly to defining and handling the b2b processes</li>
    <li>Updated and maintained the documentations for customers</li>
    <li>Created suitable onpremises images, distributed them, and managed setup troubleshooting for the customers</li>
    <li>Handled transitioning of the customers to our Customer Success team</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>My Takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring product stability on a (somewhat) universal appliance is extremely difficult to manage, especially with ever-changing SaaS applications</li>
    <li>It takes exceptional patience and ability to analyze issues with very limited information at hand for security reasons</li>
    <li>The responsibility was ultimately worthwhile as it involved a lot of challenges to solve and overcome, and I learned to take a critical part in orchestrating communication and processes both internally and externally.</li>
</ul>
