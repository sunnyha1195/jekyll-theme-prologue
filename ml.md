This is the topic I had my bachelor thesis for Computational Linguistics on. For this thesis, I have gathered a large set of Korean nouns from wiktionary, applied synthetic data generation, and did simple machine learning tasks to see if a computer can identify the root of the Korean nouns between Sino-Korean roots and pure Korean roots. <a href="/thesis.pdf">You can read more about it here</a>.
