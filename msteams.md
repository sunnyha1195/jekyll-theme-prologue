<p> 
<strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> is one of the solutions that try to tackle the struggle that comes with orchestrating and optimizing communication within the group, which has only been worsened by the pandemic at hand, freezing up majority of the business trips, offline meetings, and conferences. It has its strength in offering a possibility to build a company-wide, work ecosystem within Teams that primarily uses its Channels and Tabs features to integrate all of the company's tools into one central location.

<h3><b>My Responsibilities</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Worked as the technical lead in the project to integrate Conceptboard into Microsoft Teams</li>
    <li>Conducted research on competitor integration flows, Teams integration documentations, and our current codebase</li>
    <li>Wrote <a href="/prw"><strong>functional and non-functional requirements</strong></a> for the implementation and overall integration of MS Teams based on the research</li>
    <li>Wrote requirements for the sub-components of the project that would greatly improve the UX/UI flow for the users</li>
    <li>Implemented the backend components of the project using Java and JSP</li>
    <li>Collaborated with Product and Frontend developers for frontend component and overall quality assurance</li>
    <li>Handled the technical portion of the Microsoft Teams app submission process</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>My Takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is extremely important to break down big projects into smaller, manageable components and sprints</li>
    <li>Even better would have been having smaller projects instead of a big project with multiple, complicated components</li>
    <li>It is important to ensure that the requirements are discussed enough that no changes in the middle of the sprint is possible</li>
    <li>As difficult as it was personally, I do and did enjoy taking a lead and help bringing a much needed feature out to our customers</li>
